Fandol Fonts with Stroke Order

This fork aims to make a Stroke Order font out of the FandolKai-Regular for Hanzi handwriting learning purposes. It is inspired by the Kanji Stroke Order font (http://www.nihilist.org.uk/) and Chinese Stroke Order font (http://rtega.be/chmn/index.php?subpage=68). The latter seems to use PL UKai as the base font, which uses glyphs different from the official Mainland China glyphs. (For instance, the following characters are really different from the official form on it: 皂, 刃, 均, 填, 植, 若, 草, 苦, 莫, 漠, among others)
